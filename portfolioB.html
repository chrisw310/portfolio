<h1>Depicture Part B</h1>

<h2>In this part of the project, I produced:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Collected feedback from presentation</li>
  <li>Conducted a paper prototype test for usability testing</li>
  <li>Designed and helped implement the Minimum Viable Product</li>
  <li>Proposed changes to the design based on paper prototype feedback</li>
</ol>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<h3>Concept Feedback</h3>

<p>Before any development began, feedback on the concept was needed. To collect feedback, a poster and presentation was developed in order to demonstrate the design and the concept of the application. </p>

<img src="portfolioB/image001.jpg"/>

<p>This presentation would be presented to a room of around 30 people...</p>

<img src="portfolioB/image003.jpg"/>

<p>...and a group of 4 people would fill in a critique form and hand in to our group after the presentation:</p>

<img src="portfolioB/image005.jpg"/>

<p>As a whole, the audience reacted positively to the concept. The following feedback was collected following the presentation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>More clarity on the research goals - One person found that the purpose of the application was quite unclear. It was unclear what kind of data was being collected and what it was being used for.</li>
  <li>Have information on the images pulled - One person suggested adding information on the image underneath the image itself in order to inform the user on what they are drawing.</li>
  <li>Need to consider moderation - Another person was more concerned about the implementation than the design. She stressed the need for a moderation system in which users could report images, audio and drawings in which the user might find inappropriate for an application suitable for all ages. This feedback formed the basis of refining the application concept in future implementations. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>To test the interactions developed, a usability test was constructed to collected feedback on how users might use the application. A paper prototype was developed in order for interactions to be tested before development began:</p>

<img src="portfolioB/image007.jpg"/>

<p>Users would interact with the paper prototype like they would with a digital application. </p>

<img src="portfolioB/image009.jpg"/>

<p>Users would interact with every screen using pre-constructed user journeys, such as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drawing an image in free draw</li>
  <li>Conducted a paper prototype test for usability testing</li>
  <li>Voting on an image in the gallery</li>
  <li>Competing against a friend in competitive play.</li>
</ol>

<p>Users would follow each user journey while key observations were written down. After the test, users were able to express any thought that they had with the program.</p><br>

<p>Feedback yielded the following conclusions made about the application:</p>
    
<ul>
  <li>Application purpose was not clear - The most important feedback came from the discussion with the user afterwards. Most of the users expressed confusion on how to play the game. The idea of the game is that the user will listen to the music, and use the image as a prompt on what to draw. Users did not know that the image was merely a prompt, rather than an integral part of the application. Users felt like they had to find a correlation between the image and the music, which proved to be very difficult for them. A major overhaul of the main game would be needed to become entertaining and engaging for users.</li><br>
  <li>Some screens were not clear in their purpose or intended interaction - Many users were left confused in key places like the gallery and the image draw screen to which elements were interactive. For example, users could not figure out where to vote up or down in the gallery screen. Users were found to click on the image instead on the arrows on the screen shown below:</li><br>


<img src="portfolioB/image011.png"/>

<li>Users tended to only use one colour to draw - Despite being given the option of multiple colours, users tended to stick to one colour for drawing an image. This is most likely for simplicity reasons, due to the fact that there is a time limit on the game, users were not inclined to waste time selecting colours to draw with.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Changes Proposed</h2>
<p>In light of the new feedback, major changes were needed to be made to the concept to reflect the feedback from both the presentation and the usability test:  </p><br>
<h3>Change gallery screen</h3> 
<p>The gallery screen design was overhauled in order for the voting system to be made more clear. Since users generally pressed the button to vote, this interaction was embraced by embedding the voting system with the image:</p>

<img src="portfolioB/image015.png"/>

<p>As a further improvement, the image would zoom to the center of the screen for maximum visibility.</p>

	<h3>Context-aware hints</h3>
	
	<img src="portfolioB/image017.png"/>
		
<p>This change is in response to some interactions and screens not being fully clear to the user. At the top of any screen will be a yellow circle with a question mark inside. Clicking on the circle will reveal a helpful guide on the purpose and the interaction of each screen. The hint box will only show what is relevant to the screen that would be currently displayed.</p>

<h3>Less constraint on the game functionality</h3>
<p>Users found the time constraint to be either restrictive to creativity or pointless for the game functionality. Originally, the image draw would last around 15 seconds. Instead, the timer will be extended to one minute, thereby freeing up the user to put more detail into their drawings and therefore increasing the creative expression. The increase in the time limit will also ensure that drawings made in game are comparable to the ones drawn in Free Draw.</p><br>
	
<p>Minimum viable product was developed to reflect these changes. I implemented the design of the MVP. Implemented just the game draw stage to demonstrate that both images and audio work. The Trove and canvas implementation were done by other group members.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>This part of the project was not without its' share of successes and failures. The project was a success in the sense that feedback was vital to creating proposed changes to the design. We have a clear vision going forward in what the project might look like and operate as the final product. The technique to collect feedback was successful and provided a consensus to how the project should move going forward. I realised that testing should be at the forefront of the design process, and not just be a step in the process as a means to validate the current designs. More often than not, there would be something that does not come across to the user in the communication of the design, and user testing makes this apparent.</p><br>

<p>To put the same thing in a negative light, the project was a failure in the sense that major changes were needed to be made in order for users to feel comfortable with the application. This came about because there was not enough user testing before the implementation of the product was done. The group assumed what the user would understand and not understand and did not stop to ask users to try out the application. Testing made throughout the design process would ensure that issues with the application would be made note of immediately, rather than when the application is mostly implemented, and would require major backtracking to suit user needs.</p><br>

<p>On the group work side, the project was successful in that we all successfully implemented the product that was set out to be done. Communication was especially good, as we all attended meetings and used techniques such as using a whiteboard to communicate design ideas. This ensured that everyone was up to date on each other's progress, and actively understood their contribution to the project.</p><br>

<p>Unfortunately, the planning of future tasks was where the group fell short. My idea of 'secondary tasks', where group members would help out another group member was not successful. People focused on primary tasks, and disregarded the secondary task. Group members including myself helped out because someone needed it, rather than because it was part of their assigned task. In hindsight, this is more natural to group members than boxing them into certain roles. It was hoped that it would take the stress off each group member by letting them focus on certain tasks, but this did not turn out to be the case. </p><br>

<p>Furthermore, planning of the next phase was not detailed. The group had previously constructed a project plan to guide the way in which the project implementation is approached. The following is an example of the project plan for the next part of the project:</p>

<img src="portfolioB/image023.png"/>

<p>However, the plan became disregarded almost immediately as new problems and issues came about, which changed the schedule in which tasks would be done. Some group members did not even see the plan, and therefore did not follow the plan at all. To make matters worse, there was no stated way in the planning in how to handle unexpected issues or changes to the schedule. As a result, the plan was difficult to follow when we deviated from the plan even in the slightest. The plan constructed eventually became useless for the project process, which made for a very messy and unscheduled development phase.</p>
<h3>Improvements Proposed</h3>

<p>In light of the problems encountered, the following improvements have been suggested to the project process:</p><br>

<ol>
  <li>Conduct usability testing throughout the project - Usability testing has proven to be vitally important to the design process. In hindsight, I would conduct usability tests throughout the design process, rather than for just one stage of the project. Doing usability tests early ensure that problems can be addressed before they are too costly in resources to fix. Doing usability tests later in the project ensure that the incremental changes along the way to not impact on the usability aspect of the project. Usability tests to not have to be as detailed as the one conducted in this project, but it does need to be consistent and frequent throughout the project schedule. Furthermore, these usability tests will feature more quantitative data in order for usability test can be accurately compared and contrasted with each other.</li><br>
  <li>Provide a more comprehensive project plan - I would implement a project plan that would be more detailed in manner, and more flexible to changing circumstances. This would ensure that there is no error for confusion with what was to be achieved, and that group members would be more inclined to follow the plan if it reflected the context in which what was already completed and to be completed. I would achieve this by constructing the plan will all group members present at a meeting, and ensure that everyone has seen and will agree to the new plan. This plan will be divided by week, just like plan above. I would revisit the plan every weekly meeting and ask what progress has been made since last week. If significant progress has been made, I will move some tasks forward. If there are still lingering issues in the way, then I will move tasks back or possible reorganise the plan. This would also provide a platform in which group members can tell the group how much progress they are making and what issues need to be addressed before further progress can be made.</li><br>
  <li>Be more open to changing project management strategies - Now that I have accepted that circumstances in the project is more likely to rapidly change than not, I will be more open to the way in which projects are managed and developed. For example, when I could see that the project plan was not being followed, I should address the problem immediately and look into why people are not following the plan. This is much more effective than hoping that the group members will follow the plan eventually, which never happened. Being more open to changes ensures that projects can get back on track even in the light of unexpected issues to challenges along the way.</li>
