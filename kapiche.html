    <h1>Kapiche</h1>

    <p>In the mid-year break of 2017, I worked as a User Experience Design Intern at Kapiche, a startup dedicated to the visualisation and analysis of unstructured data.</p>

    <p>Clients of Kapiche include Nissan, Renault, Toyota, Credit Union Australia, Colmar Brunton, and Bendigo Bank.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>

    <p>It is estimated that 80% of business information is in unstructured (qualitative) form. Data analysis for unstructured data typically takes much time and resources to analyse and generate visualisations from. Competing data analytics software is very expensive and not an ideal investment for smaller companies with limited resources.</p>

    <p>Kapiche is an analytics and visualisation program that runs directly in the web browser. It offers rich visualisations of excel spreadsheets with unstructured (qualitative) data at a competitive price point for small businesses.</p>

    <p>None of the employees at Kapiche specialised in usability or user experience. My primary task was to develop wireframes, run heuristic evaluations and conduct usability tests to ensure that the interface is usable, understandable, and pleasurable for the user.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <p>I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the entire website with another intern. This involved going through each possible screen and weighing them up against Nielsen’s 10 heuristics for usability design:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Visibility of system status</li>
      <li>Match between system and the real world</li>
      <li>User control and freedom</li>
      <li>Consistency and standards</li>
      <li>Error prevention</li>
      <li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
      <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
      <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
      <li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
      <li>Help and documentation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A document of 50+ usability problems was compiled and suggested solutions were developed for each one. These were placed in a development backlog for addressing later. </p>

    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
    
    <p>For large interface changes, wireframes were developed within Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Some were hand drawn to determine layout, then sketched digitally to form a higher fidelity proof of concept. Implementations of these interfaces would be done by myself.</p>

    <h2>Usability Tests</h2>
    
    <p>To evaluate the user needs and usability of the product, I conducted a series of one hour usability tests with real world customers. These usability tests were conducted over Google Hangouts. The video stream was recorded, and notes were taken throughout the test.</p>

    <p>The usabilty tests were structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open ended questions on the context of their use.</li>
      <li>A cognitive walkthrough of a set of tasks to achieve within a certain time limit.</li>
      <li>Open ended questions on their thoughts while completing the task.</li>
      <li>Statements which reflect Donald Norman’s Usability Goals were read to the user to grade on a Likert scale of ‘Strongly Disagree’ to ‘Strongly Agree’.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Key insights on usability were found during the cognitive walkthrough, such as the structure and working of various tables, and the categorisation of different visualisations.</p>
    
    <h2>Live UI</h2>

    <p>The interface would dynamically analyse and display tweets about the event. It showcases the visualisation Kapiche has to offer and to draw attention to the product.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    
    <p>The Data Usage screen is a visualisation to show how much ‘data units’ the user has used up. Data units are points which a customer purchases to analyse more data. The graph was created with the help of d3.js and the metricsgraphics.js library.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Kapiche and learnt a lot about how the design process works in practice. </p>

    <p>Next time, I would improve on the following aspects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Involve the entire team to the design process. This would mean conducting workshops on establishing requirements and finding a solution. Collaboration is key to designing and implementing a solution.</li>
      <li>Rely less on intuition for developing wireframes and conduct more usability tests to receive valuable feedback for my designs.</li>
      <li>Sketches were too high fidelity for a design that was not even tested yet. Created a lower fidelity prototype, test first, then use results to move on to a higher fidelity prototype. Instead of Illustrator or Photoshop, use Balsamiq or hand draw prototypes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>After my time there, Kapiche went on to achieve success in growth and new investments: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Received $100,000 funding from the Queensland Government</li>
      <li>Selected for the River City Labs Startup Accelerator (10 out of 136 startups were accepted).</li>
      <li>Recieved more customers such as Bendigo and Adelaide Bank which use the product for their business needs.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Kapiche now serves many customers from across Australia and the world.</p>
