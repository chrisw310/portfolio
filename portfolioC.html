<h1>Depicture Part C</h1>
<h2>In this part of the project, I produced:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The design and layout of the final product under HTML and CSS</li>
  <li>Usability tests of an interactive prototype</li>
  <li>A demonstration of the application</li>
  <li>A document outlining key features, processes and design decisions of the application</li>
</ol>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The project up to this point was demonstrated to an audience. Various questions were asked about what features were most important to users. The following feedback was generated from this demonstration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The game part of the application is the most compelling element within the application - Audience members felt that the only reason they would use the application in the first place is because of the competitive gameplay. In response to this, the priority of development was shifted from the 'free draw' mode to the competitive game mode.</li>
  <li>Username identification is preferred, especially within competitive gameplay - Audience members expressed a desire to have unique usernames when playing against each other, rather than play anonymously. This feedback was accepted, but it was concluded that users just want to a way to identify each other, and a temporary game handle should be sufficient to fill the needs of the users.</li>
  <li>A dedicated "how to play" section would be helpful for learning how to play - Audience members expressed enthusiasm for a tutorial screen separate from the games. This feedback was rejected, because a dedicated tutorial screen would be too detached from the game, while being too detailed for someone who wants to figure out how to use a single element of the application. Instead, the contextually-aware help button remained as part of the design. </li>
</ol>

<p>A high-fidelity prototype was developed out of the Minimum Viable Product to test the user's response to key interactions and visual elements. Non-essential design elements such as images and help screens were left to a later date in the interest of developing a complete prototype for the usability test.</p><br>

<p>A usability test was conducted with 5 users to collect feedback on the concept, and key interactions with the application. This was conducted with the same procedure as the paper prototype, in order to provide consistent and comparable feedback to previous iterations.</p><br>

<img src="portfolioC/image003.jpg"/>

<p>Users had very negative impressions of the application. Users were even more confused on the purpose of the application. The interactions were clear, but the game led people to be confused on why the game would be fun or entertaining. This is because users were prompted with both audio and an image from Trove, which meant that users were confused on which one they should draw. The idea was that users would listen to the audio, and use the image as a prompt to draw something, but users felt like they had to draw both the image and the audio into one drawing. This felt very challenging to do for the users. Furthermore, users found guessing the genre of a drawing to be very difficult and unfair. This combination of user feedback led the group to conclude that users were not very enthusiastic about the application's concept, and a change was needed to make the game more enjoyable and appealing.</p><br>

<p>After the usability tests, a major overhaul of the mechanics of the game were made. The music and images in "Free Draw" were placed into their own game modes "Music Draw" and "Free Draw" respectively. This meant that the drawing prompts were greatly simplified and the media source could be isolated from the other source when doing research analysis. </p><br>

<p>It was also decided that the focus would be taken away from genres and towards individual media sources. Users would guess the drawings not by genre, but by the original source. They would be prompted with 4 options: the correct answer, and three other randomly generated answers. The gallery page was also merged into one page, as the genre tags were rendered meaningless for the user experience.</p><br>


<p>An alternative colour scheme was proposed by other group member, but the design was rejected because of the large deviation from the tested design, and some technical issues that were present in the proposed design and not the original design, such as misaligned buttons:</p><br>

<p> The high-fidelity prototype became the basis for the final product. I was responsible for fixing scaling issues with the application. There were compatibility issues with different screen sizes and form factors. Various CSS decisions were made such as giving the height and width of elements fixed values, rather than values which dynamically change for each screen size, and adjusting margins so that elements stay in the middle of the screen on every screen size.</p><br>

<p>The final product was demonstrated at a trade show alongside other applications. This would be chance to market the application and get crucial feedback on how appealing the concept and application are. </p><br>

<p>
    I prepared a 2-minute speech demonstrating what the application is and how it works. There were a few last-minute bugs that were apparent in the program, but they were left alone as there was no time left, and the demonstration was the most important part, rather than bug fixing.</p><br>

<p>Users expressed enthusiasm for the game, especially for the fact that digital pen input devices could be used to compete against friends in-game. Although not every feature of the application was fully functional, users were entertained by playing against each other and drawing pictures based on randomised images and music. The lack or purpose and clarity of the application were shown to be diminished greatly since the last usability test.  </p><br>

<p>After the trade show, any remaining bugs in the program were fixed by other group members, while I helped produce a document outlining the purpose of the application, the design process, and an overview of every feature:</p><br>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Overall, I believe the development was a success for these reasons:</p><br>

<ol>
    <li>Strong communication of ideas between group members - Regular meetings meant that each group member was communicating clearly newly proposed ideas. The whiteboard was a novel way in bringing forward new ideas:<br><br>
     <img src="portfolioC/image018.png"/><br>
     This meant that new ideas proposed were clearly understood and correctly implemented. This was one of the main reasons why the design succeeded in its execution.<br><br>
     </li>
  <li>The proposed design was fully implemented - The original design proposed was implemented to its' full extent, with no compromises on any part of the design. Changes were made due to usability issues, but this did not impede on the overall look and feel of the application.<br><br>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>Despite these success, some problems were faced in both the design process and the project development:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No clarity on the task roles of each individual group member - This was apparent when the alternative design was proposed by the other group member. The design proposed was fully implemented, to which I felt like the time being spent on new designs could have been spent fixing technical issues with the application. The group member made it clear that he did not like the minimal design of the application, and felt like that some white space in the application needed to be filled with some visual element.<br><br>
  
  The problem was that both myself and another group member were assigned the same role of designing the website. We were not coordinating or communicating with each other to ensure that tasks are being addressed and work made by one group member is not being 'written over' by another group member. To solve this, I made a 'to-do list' of tasks that were to be completed. This meant that group members could see what was completed, and what was yet to be completed anywhere in the development process. The document was made too late to be used to the full potential.<br><br>

  <figcaption>The to-do list document in Google Docs form</figcaption><br>
  </li>
  <li>No preparation for compatibility or scaling issues - The development process did not account for compatibility issues that would arise with different screen sizes, browsers, and form factors. As a result, each group member had a different idea to what extent the application should be compatible with different devices. Some group members thought that the application should be compatible with tablet and phone devices, and any desktop screen size. I however thought that it was only important to account for most modern desktop screen sizes. This led to wasted effort in trying to develop the application such that it was compatible for all devices, which is a very challenging task. Eventually, I let the group know that we should not get too carried away with compatibility and just focus on getting key functionality done. Group members shifted their focus away from compatibility, and towards fixing functionality. Again, it was too late in the design process for the full potential of this strategy to be realised.<br><br></li>
</ol>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
	<p>The following improvements have been suggested for future projects:</p><br>

<ol>
  <li>Perform more research and investigation to target users and devices - Early on in the design process, perform some research and investigation to who might use such an application. This is important not only to discover what unique needs users might have, but also which devices these users might use. It is important for the application to focus on the primary use case that the application would be in. For example, if the application is marketed towards university students, research should be conducted on what university students value in an application, as well as what online devices university students typically use. This means that the application will be more focused in its purpose and market, and therefore increase adoption rate and success of the final implementation.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>Clearly communicate task roles, and keep a log of tasks - In the project planning phase, group members need to be fully aware of their roles in the project, what tasks they are required to undertake, and what tasks are being done by other group members. To do this, a document will be made outlining all of the roles of each individual group member. The more detail in this document, the less likely there is to be confusion over which tasks are being dealt with and need to be addressed, which impede on overall project progress. Another document will be produced to keep track of which tasks are allocated, completed, and soon to be completed. This will be in similar nature to the one shown above.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>Leave more time at the end for new issues that might arise - The project plan was made in the assumption that no major issues may arise between then and the final day. There were a few issues that arose in the last 48 hours of the project, meant that the last moments of the development process were stressful, and exhausting. In future project plans, at least 3 days before the deadline will be left free for fixing of any major or minor issues that might arise in the project. If there are no issues left with the application, then the time will be spent polishing the design and functionality of all the existing features and elements of the project.<br><br>
  </li>
