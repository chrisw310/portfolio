<h1>DePicture</h1>
<i><p>DePicture is an application designed to collect data for exploratory research. The research topic in question is ‘How are different forms of media typically depicted in drawn form?’. The research aims to find out what key concepts are drawn, what correlation there is between different drawings, and if others can correctly identify the original media from just the drawing. This research data could prove to be very useful in certain psychology and art research topics. </p><br>

<p>The application provides a way in which users can contribute to the exploratory research process. Users can either view the gallery page and see other people’s drawings, or they can participate in the data collection process by either drawing alone or within a specially designed multiplayer game.</p></i>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
<p>The process began when I brainstormed several ideas for an application involving the Trove database. This involved using post-it notes and a whiteboard. It was important to consider multiple ideas in order to compare to each other and consider which one is the best to go forward with. The ideas would be written on a post-it note, and these post-it notes would then be stuck on a whiteboard for peer critique. Other people participated in this activity which meant that ideas could be compared with. One of my post-it notes was an idea in which Trove pulls in a picture, a person draws the picture with a digital drawing widget, and the other players try to guess which of the 4 pictures the user saw as a hint to sketch with. A group of 4 was formed on the basis of this idea. These group members expressed enthusiasm for the simplicity and the potential for entertainment with a drawing game. This idea eventually evolved into the basis for the Depicture app. </p>

<h3>The Calm Before the Brainstorm</h3>

<p>After we established the idea, the first step was to establish key interactions of the game. I made a document in which key aspects of the game would be decided upon. This had two purposes: to figure out if the idea was even plausible to develop with the limited resources, and to see how detailed the application will need to be in terms of features. This ensured that the idea being pursued is both possible and clear, and also to make sure the other group members understand the idea in which the development will be based upon. Key aspects included screens, gameplay mechanics, and the points system to compliment the game. Methodically mapping out brainstorming ideas forced us to flesh out specific details and to see more clearly how the game might look as a finished product.</p>

<p>Initially, I envisioned the app to be purely a game. As the brainstorming sessions went on, we realised that the game could be used for audio as well as music. Instead of creating another drawing game that mirrors the gameplay of other games such as Pictionary, we wanted to put the application to good use. This would be by turning the game into a data-collecting application for research purposes. The game officially became a research application which aims to find out how listening to audio can change drawing, and if these changes can be noticed. To reflect this change, the application would also feature a 'free draw' screen, which would be a place for creative expression, and a 'gallery' screen where users can see other people's drawing and vote.</p>

<h3>Back to Basics</h3>
<p>After this change was established, the design of the application began. I was responsible for creating sketches of the interactions, better known as a 'task flow' diagram. This involved laying out all of the interactions the user would make with the application, as well as the various screen that the user will encounter when using the app. These sketches were done in very low fidelity in order to ensure the ability for quick changes and improvements to the task flow. </p>

<p>Next, I applied the same strategy to the storyboards. A storyboard is a single use case of the application. I chose the gameplay as the main interaction to map out, as this will most likely be the most popular use of the application. These are quite similar to the task flows, except that the context of use and step-by-step analysis of a single path of interaction is established. Making the storyboard forced me to figure out what features are missing and if the flow of screens make sense to a typical user. Drawings were quick and rough in order for rapid designing and experimenting with ideas.</p>

<h3>Digitised, colourised, and ready to go</h3>
<p>After the main interactions were established, draft sketches of the interaction screens were made on the program Sketch. A green colour scheme was chosen for its uniqueness and eye-catching nature. A high importance was placed on the use of white space and minimalism for ease of use.</p>

<p>These also formed the basis of the promotional poster.</p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Overall, I believe that this part of the project was a success. This is because the group work delegation worked very well with no major conflict of interest, and that the tasks established at the start of the project were met. Not only was the project successful in progressing the implementation, but I learned a lot about group work and communication. Visual communication was key to coordinating a group to deliver a product, and the communication made the group members feel involved in the process, and ultimately resulted in a better application.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>There were some shortcomings of the project process. 3 of the largest problems are listed below:</p>

<h3>I was too impatient</h3>
<p>The largest one was in the storyboard and task flow sketches. Initially, I wanted to create storyboards and task flows all digitally. However, this was a huge task to achieve. There were too many screens to be made, and too many details to be decided on too early in the process, such as colour and font type. It wasn't until much closer to the deadline that I realised that creating the charts digitally would not be ideal. I eventually gave up on the digital designs and drew them by hand. The drawings were very rough, and I personally am not proud of the presentation of such designs. While the drawings conveyed what was needed to move on to the next step, I should have started with hand drawing designs early on in the process so I could flesh out ideas as I make them, rather than focus on the tiny details such as colour schemes and button placements. </p>

<h3>We did not communicate enough</h3>
<p>I established early on that the group should meet at least once per week to discuss what they are doing, and where to go next. Unfortunately, we started to substitute physical meetings with Slack messages. This meant that communication with group members became more distant, and the work to be done was made unclear. For example, a group member volunteered to finish of the poster that the group was working on by filling in the blanks with descriptive text. However, the text used for the title of the poster was used for the body text, making for a very strange looking poster.</p> 

<img src="portfolioA/image013.jpg" /> <br><br>

<p>This came as a result of a lack of communication. If there was a physical meeting beforehand, the group could have worked on the problem together.</p>

<h3>Departmentalisation</h3>
<p>A side effect of the lack of communication was what I like to call 'departmentalisation' Early on in the process, each member of the group stated what skills that they might have that would contribute to the project. For example, I wanted to take control of the visual and interaction design of the project. These became what we called 'Primary roles' for the design process. Unfortunately, I became the 'design guy', which implies that I am solely responsible for all design issues, and anyone that wants to help me is not welcome. This meant that I did not ask for help when I needed it, and I was out of the loop on how the other group members were going with their part of the work. This cost me dearly in the sketches, as I needed help trying to establish what interactions will take place and how the app will be used effectively.</p> 

<h2>Improvements Proposed </h2>
<h3>The case for 'incremental' designs</h3>
<p>If I were to make improvements, I would try out 'incremental' designs. That means I would do extremely rough sketches initially, then build upon each design with more detail. In the project, I started trying to produce highly detailed sketches, which slowed down my design process, and did not allow for me to consider other design options rapidly. If I had thought of a better idea, I would not be inclined to follow it, as I would have already have spent so much time on high-fidelity designs. Starting with low-fidelity designs ensures that the fundamentals of the application and interactions are met first. This would in turn improve the visual designs, as a solid foundation would have been established. Unique ideas would then be easily tested, considered, and discarded. Start small, then go big.</p>

<h3>More communication, more satisfaction</h3>
<p>The mantra I repeat to myself now is the more communication, the more satisfaction. This was not enough. In retrospect, I would set a hard rule for at least 2 physical meetings per week. That way we are not only keeping up to date with progress, but we are also helping each other on problems that arise. Less communicate
    on increases the risk for 'departmentalisation', where each person is assigned a 'role', and everyone is too busy with their own role in the project as opposed to seeing how their work fits into the bigger picture. It increases the sense of purpose, and motivates the team to work harder. The more meetings, the better the project will turn out to be at the end.</p>

<h3>Cross-pollination with secondary tasks</h3>
<p>For the next part of the project, I propose the idea of 'secondary tasks'. This combines the benefit of putting each group member's strengths to good use while minimising the effects of the dreaded 'departmentalisation'. Each group member will have their primary tasks, and the will also have another group member's task of their choice as a 'secondary' task. The group member will supervise and help the other person with their secondary task as their primary task. This means that all group members will have someone that supervises and helps with their work, and can also find out if they are making progress in relation to other group members. Secondary tasks will hold group members accountable, and will create healthy competition.</p>
